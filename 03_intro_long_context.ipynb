    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, large language models (LLMs) were significantly limited by the amount of text (or tokens) that could be passed to the model at one time. Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro support a 1 million token context window, with [near-perfect retrieval (>99%)](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf), which unlocks many new use cases and developer paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, 1 million tokens would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   50,000 lines of code (with the standard 80 characters per line)\n",
    "-   All the text messages you have sent in the last 5 years\n",
    "-   8 average length English novels\n",
    "-   Transcripts of over 200 average length podcast episodes\n",
    "-   1 hour of video\n",
    "-   ~45 minutes of video with audio\n",
    "-   9.5 hours of audio\n",
    "\n",
    "While the standard use case for most generative models is still text input, the Gemini 1.5 model family enables a new paradigm of multimodal use cases. These models can natively understand text, video, audio, and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore multimodal use cases of the long context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, refer to the [Gemini documentation about long context](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/long-context)."

    "## Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens can be single characters like `z` or whole words like `cat`. Long words\n",
    "are broken up into several tokens. The set of all tokens used by the model is\n",
    "called the vocabulary, and the process of splitting text into tokens is called\n",
    "_tokenization_.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important:** For Gemini models, a token is equivalent to about 4 characters. 100 tokens is equal to about 60-80 English words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For multimodal input, this is how tokens are calculated regardless of display or file size:\n",

    "## Why is the long context window useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic way you use the Gemini models is by passing information (context)\n",
    "to the model, which will subsequently generate a response. An analogy for the\n",
    "context window is short term memory. There is a limited amount of information\n",
    "that can be stored in someone's short term memory, and the same is true for\n",
    "generative models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about how models work under the hood in our [generative models guide](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the models can take in more and more context, much of the\n",
    "conventional wisdom about using large language models assumes this inherent\n",
    "limitation on the model, which as of 2024, is no longer the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common strategies to handle the limitation of small context windows\n",
    "included:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Arbitrarily dropping old messages / text from the context window as new text\n",
    "    comes in\n",
    "-   Summarizing previous content and replacing it with the summary when the\n",
    "    context window gets close to being full\n",
    "-   Using RAG with semantic search to move data out of the context window and\n",
    "    into a vector database\n",
    "-   Using deterministic or generative filters to remove certain text /\n",
    "    characters from prompts to save tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "While many of these are still relevant in certain cases, the default place to start is now just putting all of the tokens into the context window. Because Gemini 1.5 models were purpose-built with a long context window, they are much more capable of in-context learning. This means that instructional materials provided in context can be highly effective for handling inputs that are not covered by the model's training data."

       "\n",
       "Leo Tolstoy's epic novel, *War and Peace*, is a sprawling tale encompassing the lives of five aristocratic Russian families during the Napoleonic Wars. It explores themes of love, marriage, war, peace, and the individual's role within history. \n",
       "\n",
       "**The Story:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Book One (1805):** The story begins in St. Petersburg where we meet Anna Pávlovna Schérer, a socialite hosting a gathering of high society. Among the guests are Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a scheming nobleman seeking a political appointment for his son; the beautiful Hélène, his daughter; and Prince Andrew Bolkónski, a disillusioned and cynical young aristocrat. \n",
       "* **Book Two (1805):** We witness the Russian army's arrival in Austria and the burgeoning romance between young Natásha Rostóva, a lively and vibrant girl, and Borís Drubetskóy, an officer seeking a position on Kutúzov’s staff. \n",
       "* **Book Three (1805):** The story shifts to the battle of Austerlitz, where Prince Andrew witnesses the brutality of war and his hero, Napoleon, in a less-than-ideal light. He suffers a serious wound and nearly dies, undergoing a spiritual transformation.\n",
       "* **Book Four (1806):** Pierre Bezúkhov, an illegitimate son, inherits a vast fortune after his father's death, leading to a whirlwind of social expectations and manipulation by Prince Vasíli, who orchestrates his marriage to Hélène. \n",
       "* **Book Five (1806-07):** Pierre becomes a Freemason and embarks on a journey of self-improvement, ultimately seeking a more virtuous and meaningful life. He also divorces Hélène and distances himself from the Kurágins.\n",
       "* **Book Six (1808-10):** Prince Andrew lives a more introspective and detached life in the countryside, focusing on his estates and writing. He encounters Pierre again, who tries to introduce him to Freemasonry, but Prince Andrew is still grappling with his disillusionment.\n",
       "* **Book Seven (1810-11):** As Napoleon’s armies prepare for the invasion of Russia, we see both the political machinations and the social anxieties leading up to the war. Prince Andrew returns to the military, seeking a way to make a difference.\n",
       "* **Book Eight (1811-12):** The invasion of Russia begins. We witness the battles of Austerlitz, Schön Grabern, and the capture of the Thabor Bridge at Vienna. Rostóv joins the army and experiences the horrors of war firsthand. \n",
       "* **Book Nine (1812):** The narrative centers on the Battle of Borodinó, a turning point in the war.  Prince Andrew is mortally wounded, and Pierre witnesses the horrors of the battlefield, leading him to a desire for change. \n",
       "* **Book Ten (1812):** Moscow is abandoned and burned, and Napoleon’s army retreats through Russia. The novel explores the Russian people’s response to the invasion and the impact of the war on both individuals and society.\n",
       "* **Book Eleven (1812):** Pierre becomes a \"citizen-soldier\" after experiencing a profound spiritual transformation in captivity. He seeks to make a difference in the world.\n",
       "* **Book Twelve (1812):** The French army flees from Russia in a disastrous retreat, with Napoleon making various misguided decisions. The novel highlights the importance of the guerrilla warfare carried out by the Russians.\n",
       "* **Book Thirteen (1812):** The retreat continues, with the Russian army pursuing the weakened French forces. Prince Andrew dies in the arms of Natásha, who is deeply affected by his passing.\n",
       "* **Book Fourteen (1812):** The novel explores the impact of the war on Russian society and the conflicting views about how to best defend the country. \n",
       "* **Book Fifteen (1812-13):** Natásha and Princess Mary find solace and support in each other after Prince Andrew’s death. Nicholas, after being freed from his commitment to Sónya, finds himself drawn to Princess Mary. Pierre's journey of self-discovery continues. \n",
       "* **Epilogue (1813-20):**  We see the long-term consequences of the war on the characters and their families. Natásha marries Pierre, and Nicholas marries Princess Mary. They find love and happiness, but the scars of war and the loss of loved ones are still felt deeply. The novel concludes with the lives of the characters evolving, embracing peace and new beginnings, but also acknowledging the enduring impact of the events they lived through.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Themes:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **War and Peace:** The novel explores the profound impact of war on both individuals and society, contrasting the brutality of battle with the yearning for peace.\n",
       "* **Love and Family:** Love, in all its forms—romantic, familial, and spiritual—is a central theme. The novel explores the complexities of marriage, the bond between siblings, and the importance of family.\n",
       "* **Fate vs. Free Will:** The novel grapples with the interplay between fate and free will, considering how individual choices intersect with historical forces beyond our control.\n",
       "* **Faith and Spirituality:**  The novel examines the role of faith in individual lives and the search for meaning in a chaotic and often unjust world.\n",
       "* **Social Change:** The novel reflects the social upheaval of the early 19th century, exploring the dynamics of power, class, and the evolving roles of women in society.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Significance:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* War and Peace is considered one of the greatest novels ever written, lauded for its scope, realism, character development, and philosophical depth.\n",
       "* Its exploration of universal themes, combined with its historical context, makes it a timeless work of literature relevant to readers today.\n",
       "* The novel challenges traditional conceptions of heroism and war, questioning the role of individual actors in history and emphasizing the importance of the collective experience of humanity.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In Conclusion:** \n",
       "\n",
       "War and Peace is a profound and moving exploration of the human condition, offering a rich tapestry of individual lives interwoven with the tapestry of history itself. Its insights into the nature of love, war, and human destiny continue to resonate with readers today. \n"
